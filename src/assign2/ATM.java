 * This is the ATM class, which defines the blueprint for ATM objects that hold 3 data members. 
 * An ATM can call addAccount() in order to create an instance of a BankAccount object and add it to the Vector 
 * collection data member "accounts" with an encrypted password. Additionally, an ATM can call getMoney() which
 * withdraws (subtracts) money from the balance of a BankAccount instance inside of "accounts" Vector given the 
 * correct account ID and password for the account.

	 * The accounts data member is a Vector object that holds all instances of BankAccount associated

	 * of BankAccount in the "accounts" vector then we can safely add the new instance of BankAccount. Additionally, if

	/**
	 * The addAccount class method for the ATM class. This function takes in the same four parameters that is necessary
	 * to create an instance of the BankAccount class (account ID, name, balance, and password) and adds a new instance of the 
	 * BankAccount class to the "accounts" Vector (assuming that valid values for the BankAccount instance were given or that the
	 * parameter value for account ID is not the same account ID as another BankAccount instance already in the "accounts" Vector).
	 * 
	 * If the passed String for the account ID is either an empty string or a null value, then we print out a message to the 
	 * user and return. This is because without a valid account number it is impossible to search for an already pre-existing 
	 * instance of BankAccount in the "accounts" Vector to ensure that the accountID of the new account is not the same as a 
	 * pre-existing account in the Vector. 
	 * 
	 * This function takes in three strings for accndId, name, and password, as well as a double for balance and generates an 
	 * instance of BankAccount with the values of accndId, name, balance, and the encrypted value of password utilizing the 
	 * Caesar Cipher algorithm. If the values passed for any of the three String arguments (accndId, name, and balance) is 
	 * either an empty string or null value then the constructor of BankAccount will throw an Illegal Argument Exception. 
	 * Additionally, if the value passed for balance is either a negative value or less than the value of the static variable
	 * minimumBalance found in the BankAccount class, then the constructor of BankAccount will also throw an Illegal Argument 
	 * Exception.
	 * 
	 * If this function is called and the "accounts" vector is empty, then as long as there is valid parameter values, a new 
	 * BankAccount instance will be appended to the "accounts" vector with an encrypted password. However, if the "accounts" 
	 * vector is not empty, then the function will iterate through all instances of BankAccount in the "accounts" Vector and see
	 * whether or not an instance of BankAccount shares the same account ID as the parameter value of acctId, if it does then
	 * a message is printed to the user and the function is returned, and if it is not, then the instance of BankAccount is created
	 * and appended to the "accounts" Vector.
	 * 
	 * The reason I choose to code print functions instead of including Illegal Argument Exceptions here in the ATM class is because 
	 * of the functionality of this program. Even though the test cases in the main function of ATM will not include these cases, 
	 * for normal functionality of the program it seems to be a good idea to make it clear to the user that certain cases are 
	 * not accepted, and as such it is easer to tell the user through print statements instead of throwing exceptions.
	 * 
	 * Again, like with the BankAccount class, it is difficult to write this code as the assignment does not make it 
	 * explicitly clear what is to be done in these edge cases of incorrect inputs, so I am using my best judgment and applying
	 * most of the logic for exceptions to the BankAccount class rather than the ATM class (as there is very little 
	 * purpose in re-writing exceptions that will apply for both classes).
	 * 
	 * @param accndId the account ID value of the BankAccount instance as a String, used to search for existing instances 
	 * @param name the name of the owner of the BankAccount instance as a String
	 * @param balance the current balance of the BankAccount instance as a double
	 * @param password the password to access the BankAccount instance as a String, encrypted with Caesar Cipher algorithm

	/**
	 * The getMoney() class method for the ATM class. This function takes in three parameters (account ID, amount, and password) 
	 * and tries to withdraw (or subtract) the passed value of amount from an instance of BankAccount in the "accounts" Vector
	 * that matches the passed values of account ID and password. 
	 * 
	 * If the passed String for the account ID and/or password is either an empty string or a null value, then we print out 
	 * a message to the user and return. This is because without a valid account number and/or password it is impossible 
	 * to search for an already pre-existing instance of BankAccount in the "accounts" Vector and withdraw from this account (as
	 * we can't find a instance of BankAccount without a valid account ID and we can't access the instance of BankAccount without
	 * the correct password).
	 * 
	 * If this function is called and the "accounts" vector is empty, then we print out to the user that we cannot withdraw from any
	 * BankAccount instances (as there are none to withdraw from). If the password given is incorrect (but an instance of BankAccount with
	 * the passed account ID does exist) then the user is printed a message saying that the password is wrong. And finally, if there are 
	 * no instances of BankAccount in the "accounts" vector that matched the passed value of account ID, then a message is printed to the 
	 * user saying that the given account does not exist.
	 * 
	 * The reason I choose to code print functions instead of including Illegal Argument Exceptions here in this method is because 
	 * of the test cases used in the main() function. There is a instance in the main() function of the ATM class where an account 
	 * with the correct ID, but incorrect password is called with the getMoney() function. If I were to throw an IllegalArgumentException 
	 * in this function then the other test cases would not be executed and it would be difficult to prove the normal functionality
	 * of the ATM class.
	 * 
	 * Again, like with the BankAccount class, it is difficult to write this code as the assignment does not make it 
	 * explicitly clear what is to be done in these edge cases of incorrect inputs, so I am using my best judgment and applying
	 * most of the logic for exceptions to the BankAccount class (for the withdraw function in this case) rather than the ATM class

	 * @param accndId the account ID value of the BankAccount instance as a String, used to search for existing instances

	 * @param password the password to access the BankAccount instance as a String, encrypted with Caesar Cipher algorithm
	 * @return the amount withdrawn from one of the instances of BankAccount stored in the "accounts" vector
